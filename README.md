# Atari-Digital-Video
Add pixel-perfect HDMI output to the Amiga machines.

For all Amiga versions that have a socketed Denise chip, a rather small adapter board can
be used to extract the digital video signal (12 bit) to a 40-pin connector compatible
with the a Raspberry Pi Zero. This can then use a variant of the RGBtoHDMI software 
to produce a perfect HDMI picure with very low latency (a few milliseconds at most).
